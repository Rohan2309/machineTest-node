# 🛒 Product Management System

A simple **Product Listing Portal** built with **Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and EJS**.  
The system provides two portals:

- **Admin Panel (/admin)** – Manage Categories & Products (CRUD with Soft Delete).
- **Customer Portal (/)** – View and search products by category or keyword.

This project follows the **MVC architecture** and includes **file uploads (Multer), form validation (Joi), soft delete, and flash messages**.
